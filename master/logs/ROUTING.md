# ROUTING — model routing log (append-only rows; lead writes)
Routing table: CLAUDE.md "Model routing" + `.claude/agents/*.md`. Never Fable.
Columns: `time | task_type | agent | model/effort | outcome | from → to | reason`.
Outcome = `ok` | `fail` | `escalated`. Every task gets a row (needed for escalation rates); escalations add `from → to`.
Per-milestone rates: `python3 master/tools/routing-stats.py`.
